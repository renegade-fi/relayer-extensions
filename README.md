# relayer-extensions

Extensions to the Renegade relayer that provide support functionality to clusters

## NOTES (delete when ready)

Goal: build the funds manager, and hopefully other services in this repo, with v2 relayer deps.

This means making everything build towards the rengade repo's main branch.

There are some dependencies that currently point towards v1 code paths / types, and we
need to update them to point to the correct v2 paths / types.
